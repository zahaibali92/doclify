**Doclify** is an intelligent command-line tool that automates the process of documenting your AI/ML software projects. By leveraging the power of **Advanced LLMs**, Doclify scans your codebase, understands the context of each file, and generates a comprehensive, professional `README.md` file.

---

## 🚀 How to Use Doclify

Doclify is designed to be intuitive. Follow these two simple steps to document your project:

### 1. Initialize Your Project
Run the `init` command to scan your directory. Doclify will automatically detect your source files and create a `doclify.yaml` configuration file.

```bash
doclify init
```
- Supported Files: **Python, Markdown, Text Files**

*   **What happens?** Doclify respects your `.gitignore` and creates a manifest of files to be analyzed.
*   **Customization:** You can edit `doclify.yaml` to include or exclude specific files before moving to the next step.

### 2. Generate Documentation
Once initialized, run the `run` command to start the AI analysis and generate your README.

```bash
doclify run
```

*   **AI Analysis**: Doclify sends file contexts to the AI model for summarization.
*   **Incremental Progress**: You'll see beautiful progress bars and spinners as it works.
*   **Backup Security**: Doclify automatically saves your existing `README.md` to `README-prev.md` so you never lose your manual edits.

**Result:** A fully documented `README.md` appears in your project root!

## 🛠️ Detailed Command Reference

Doclify provides a set of powerful commands to manage your documentation lifecycle.

### `doclify init`
Initializes a new Doclify project in the current directory.

*   **Description**: Scans the project structure, applies `.gitignore` filtering, and generates a `doclify.yaml` file.
*   **Example**:
    ```bash
    doclify init
    ```
*   **When to use**: Run this first to define which files Doclify should consider for documentation.

### `doclify run`
Generates or regenerates the project-wide documentation.

*   **Description**: Processes all files listed in `doclify.yaml` using AI models to create a comprehensive `README.md`.
*   **Example**:
    ```bash
    doclify run
    ```
*   **When to use**: Run this after `init` or whenever you want to update your entire README based on the latest code changes.

### `doclify update <path>`
Updates documentation for a specific file or directory.

*   **Description**: Target a specific subset of your codebase for faster, incremental updates.
*   **Arguments**:
    *   `<path>`: Path to the file or directory you want to re-analyze.
*   **Example**:
    ```bash
    doclify update src/utils.py
    ```
*   **When to use**: Use this when you've modified specific files and want to refresh their summaries in the overall project context without regenerating everything.
